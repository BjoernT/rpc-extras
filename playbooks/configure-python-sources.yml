          ********************* NOTICE! *********************
          At this time there is no good way to override the repo-build process
          so that we can stash our python wheels into the repo container at build
          time without directly overriding the repo-build playbook. To make this
          work we're forcably linking the repo-build playbook to our own
          `stage-python-artifacts.yml`. Hopfully in the future we can simply
          define the code path in a more intellegent way.
