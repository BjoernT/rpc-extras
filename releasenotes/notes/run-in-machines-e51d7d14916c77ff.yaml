features:
  - All LXC containers will now run within a ``machinectl`` environment. This
    change provides for simpler image management using built in universal
    tooling. Moving to ``machinectl`` will reduce the storage required to run
    our containerized workloads while retaining the file system properties
    we've come rely on (FS barriers, auditing, etc).
upgrade:
  - With the change to ``machinectl`` as the default container back-end there's
    no upgrade impact. Existing containers running in any other file-store will
    not be touched. If the deployer wishes to move the container into the
    ``machinectl`` back-end they can as a secondary maintenance, however this is
    not required.
